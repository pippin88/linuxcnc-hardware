= Hardware to run the <nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki> software =
A computer is required to run <nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki> itself.

Minimum computer requirements can be found in the <nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki> docs: http://LinuxCNC.org/docs/stable/html/getting-started/system-requirements.html

The most common is to use a x86 computer (standard Intel / AMD computer)

ARM computers such as the Raspberry Pi or Orange Pi can be used

= Hardware Interface to CNC machine =
There are multiple different ways to interface between <nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki> controller software, and CNC hardware (such as stepper / servo drivers, limit switches, inputs and outputs etc.)

Interfaces include:
* Parallel Port
* Ethernet
* <nowiki>EtherCat</nowiki>
* PCI / PCIe
* SPI (where the computer has a native SPI interface, such as Raspberry Pi)
* USB ('''''not''''' realtime interface)

A mix of different interfaces can be used. For example, a combination of <nowiki>EtherCat</nowiki> for servo drives, and parallel port for additional General Purpose Inputs / Outputs (GPIO)

Some of these solutions are usable for all aspects of hardware interfacing, and some have specific roles (e.g. non-realtime GPIO, for an operator inferface).

== Parallel Port ==
Using onboard motherboard parallel port, or a PCI / PCIe parallel port card.

== Parallel Port Software Interface ==
Realtime (time critical) tasks such as step generation are done in software on the <nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki> host - this means the parallel port interface is much more sensitive to the <nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki> computer's latency.

Advantages:
* Low cost
* Simple configuration

Disadvantages:
* Sensitive to the <nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki> computer's latency
* Limited inputs / outputs 
* Some PCI / PCIe parallel port cards do not work well or do not properly support the required EPP mode


== Parallel Port FPGA Communication ==
Realtime (time critical) tasks such as step generation are done in hardware (not on the computer)

=== PCI and PCIe Parallel Port Cards ===
:[[Parallel port cards]] allow the addition of parallel ports beyond the built-in port on PC motherboards. These may be used for realtime functions such as software PWM and step/dir, or for user functions such as controlling coolant, tool changers, relays, etcetera. Nearly any card will work with pin changing functions (hal_parport), but very few cards are compatible with EPP, which is used with parallel port connected FPGA signal generators and controllers. Several LPT cards and their test results are listed here.<br><br>

=== VFD's ===
<html><img style="float:right" src="http://wiki.<nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki>.org/uploads/gs2_100.jpg"></html>
:Variable Frequency Drives are generally used to drive three phase spindle motors. Variable-frequency drives are also known as adjustable-frequency drives (AFD), variable-speed drives (VSD), AC drives, microdrives or inverter drives. Since the voltage is varied along with frequency, these are sometimes also called VVVF (variable voltage variable frequency) drives. Since the spindle motor is often the only truly three phase component of a CNC machine, a VFD may be used to convert a machine to single phase by either using an overrated three phase input drive or a drive designed as a single phase input drive. Voltage conversion is also a common feature that can allow one to use, for instance, a 460 Volt motor from 240 Volt mains. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-frequency_drive

:Common I/O are; the front panel,or digital inputs such as start, stop, forward, reverse, etcetera, along with analog speed as +/- 5 or 10 Volts, or Modbus RTU and Modbus Ethernet. For use with <nowiki>LinuxCNC</nowiki>, the digital, analog, and Modbus I/O are the most interesting.
