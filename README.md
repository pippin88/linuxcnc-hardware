# Linuxcnc Hardware

# Hardware to run the LinuxCNC software
A computer is required to run LinuxCNC itself

The most common is to use a x86 computer (standard Intel / AMD computer)

ARM computers such as the Raspberry Pi or Orange Pi can be used
The 

# Hardware Interface to CNC machine
There are multiple different ways to interface between LinuxCNC controller software, and CNC hardware (such as stepper / servo drivers, limits switches, inputs and outputs etc.)

Interfaces include:
Parallel Port
Ethernet
Ethercat
PCI / PCIe
SPI (where the computer has a native SPI interface, such as Raspberry Pi)
